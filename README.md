# Injectify
Welcome to Injectify ‚Äì my personal simulation lab built to understand and demonstrate how SQL Injection vulnerabilities work in web applications.

As someone diving into the world of cybersecurity and ethical hacking, I wanted to create a simple yet practical tool to test and simulate SQLi attacks in a safe, controlled environment. This project showcases how insecure database queries can be exploited ‚Äì and why it's so important to sanitize input.

Whether you're a beginner or brushing up your skills, Injectify provides hands-on exposure to:

Classic SQL injection via login forms

Exploiting GET and POST requests

Understanding how malicious payloads bypass security

üîß Built with PHP, MySQL, and HTML/CSS ‚Äì it‚Äôs easy to run locally using XAMPP or any local server stack.
