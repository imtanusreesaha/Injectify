# 🛡️ SQL Injection Simulation Lab

## 📌 Introduction  
This project is a beginner-friendly lab that simulates **SQL Injection vulnerabilities** in web applications. Built using **Java, JSP, and MySQL**, it demonstrates how insecure coding practices can expose login systems to malicious database queries. The simulation helps students, developers, and security enthusiasts understand the importance of secure coding and how to prevent common web attacks.
